- **Problem**:*A machine learning model was developed using the usage data of a mobile application to suggest the three menus that each user is most likely to need in that application. The target in the dataset consists of 9 menus, binary-coded based on the user's historical preferences. The goal is to predict which 3 menus should be added to the user interface.*
  
- **Note:** *The metric criterion is the Jaccard similarity score.*

### Explanation

- *(94049, 58)*
- *There are 54 numerical observations, with 50 of them being masked.*
- *There are 4 types of categorical data, and 1 of them is the target variable.*
- *In each target variable, there are three menus selected from among the nine menus they have used.*
- *The CatBoost algorithm has been used.*
